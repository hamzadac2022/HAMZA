                <h1>top  best 3 anime</h1>
                <p>Picking just 5 titles for this list of best anime was really difficult,
                    but our team of experts eventually came up with the top titles.We took several things into consideration when choosing our 5:
                     Did the anime leave its mark on the culture in a meaningful way?<br> Did they influence the industry and genre? And, 
                     of course,did we just like them?
                    Read on (or swipe through the slideshow) for IGN’s picks for the 5 Best Anime Series,
                     and be sure to let us know in the comments what your favorites are!</p>
